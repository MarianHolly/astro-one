## Astro Framework

### Purpose of Astro Framework

**Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Astro is primarily built to generate static sites. This means it pre-renders all pages into static HTML, making the final site highly performant and SEO-friendly.

**Component-Based Development**: Astro supports a component-based architecture, allowing developers to create reusable and maintainable UI components. It’s designed to work with popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, and others.

**Optimized Performance**: One of Astro's main goals is to deliver high-performance websites. It minimizes the amount of JavaScript sent to the browser by default, ensuring faster load times and better user experience.
